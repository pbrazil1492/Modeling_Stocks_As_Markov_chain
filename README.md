# Modeling_Stocks_As_Markov_chain
Markov chains are an extremely useful tool for modeling stochastic processes. The theory is rich spanning hundreds of years. In this code we transform stock data to fit a finite state Markov model. Once done we try to infer the percentage change in a stock's value over a predetermined time interval.
